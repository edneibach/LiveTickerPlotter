# LiveTickerPlotter
This is an IPython Notebook which will enable you to see the pricing changes, in the last 20 days, of any ticker supported by the IEX API. Currently, there's 9152 tickers you can choose from.
Usage is simple. First you need to run the first and second cells, so it loads the modules and displays a dropdown from where you can select your ticker.
Lastly, after you've selected your ticker, you only need to run the last cell and it will automatically plot a line plot. X axis is days ago, while the Y axis is the price itself.
I plan on adding more charts containing more info to this notebook in the future.
